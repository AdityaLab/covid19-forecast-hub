ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: 'A stochastic/deterministic, single-population SEIRX model that stratifies
  by both age distribution and disease severity and includes generic intervention
  fitting. '
team_funding: NSF
repo_url: https://github.com/predsci/DRAFT
data_inputs: JHU cumulative deaths,  U.S. Census populations and age distributions
methods_long: "Deterministic fit of a compartmental SEIRX model to cumulative death\
  \ profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the optimal parameters. All\
  \ compartments are stratified by age. 'I' compartments are additionally divided \
  \ by disease severity into Asymptomatic, Mild, Flu-like, and Severe.  Severe disease \
  \ is defined by the need for an ICU bed. Interventions are fit generically to an\
  \ n-value smooth function.  Forward projections are conditional on interventions\
  \ and reproductive number remaining unchanged.\n \
  \ Updates: \
  \   July 20, 2020 - model is fit using MCMC procedure\ 
  \   August 10, 2020 - R(t) is fit using n=3, 4, and 5 values. The n-value \
  \     resulting in the lowest AICc score is used for the forecast. \
  \   September 6, 2021 - Update to sampling procedure for R(t) time-intervals. \
  \   September 13, 2021 - Model now estimates system states on June 1, 2021 and\
  \     then fits to data from June 1 to present."
